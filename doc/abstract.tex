Asking "What are stars are near $S$?" is a problem that may involve iterating through millions, if not billions of
stars.
The Tycho-2 dataset allows us to reduce our search to sky regions instead of the entire star set.
The time to answer similar questions using the distributed column family database Apache Cassandra, was benchmarked
against the distributed graph database Neo4J\@.
Overall, Cassandra's query times are more tightly distributed than Neo4J times but Neo4J is able to process queries
faster if the correct indexes are applied.
